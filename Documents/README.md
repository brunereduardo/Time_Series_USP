# Time_series_USP
<p> The project's main objective is to develop the basic concepts of the theory of statistical treatment of time series, in addition to preparing the ground for the analysis, identification and forecasting of a time series.</p> 

<p>The project uses the USAccDeaths: Accidental Deaths in the US 1973-1978 database, which is a time series that provides the monthly totals of accidental deaths in the USA. The figures were taken from P. J. Brockwell and R. A. Davis (1991) Time Series: Theory and Methods. Springer, New York.</p>

<p>PFor more information, just search for the .PDF file in the folder <a href = 'https://github.com/brunereduardo/Time_Series_USP/tree/master/Documents'>Documents</a> and then we have the following points studied for this time series immersion project with R:</p>
 <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Time series: concept, smoothing, trend, seasonality, exponential smoothing</li>
  <li>Stationary series</li>
  <li>Autocovariance and autocorrelation function</li>
  <li>Models: ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA</li>
  <li>Identification</li>
  <li>Estimation</li>
  <li>Forecast</li>
  <li>Diagnostics</li>
  <li>Indexing: similarity / dissimilarity, grouping, summarization and segmentation</li>
  <li>Structural models: state space and Bayesian forecast</li>
</ul>  

## Instructions for Compiling the Source Code
To compile the program, it is only necessary to have access to the R language and the RStudio IDE and to run the project's code lines to obtain the results.
